Информация об эксплоитах для CVE:
CVE-2021-40438:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2021-40438
Описание: A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.

CVE-2021-41773:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2021-42013
Описание: It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

CVE-2019-0211:
Ссылка: https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152441/CARPE-DIEM-Apache-2.4.x-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html
Описание: 

CVE-2019-10092:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10092
Описание: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.

CVE-2019-10098:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10098
Описание: In Apache HTTP server 2.4.0 to 2.4.39, Redirects configured with mod_rewrite that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an unexpected URL within the request URL.

CVE-2020-11984:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2020-11984
Описание: Apache HTTP server 2.4.32 to 2.4.44 mod_proxy_uwsgi info disclosure and possible RCE

CVE-2020-11993:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2020-11993
Описание: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 When trace/debug was enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2 above "info" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

CVE-2021-42013:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2021-42013
Описание: It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed.

CVE-2023-25690:
Ссылка: https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176334/Apache-2.4.55-mod_proxy-HTTP-Request-Smuggling.html
Описание: 

CVE-2023-44487:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2023-45802
Описание: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

CVE-2021-34798:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2021-34798
Описание: Malformed requests may cause the server to dereference a NULL pointer. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.

CVE-2021-39275:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2021-39275
Описание: ap_escape_quotes() may write beyond the end of a buffer when given malicious input. No included modules pass untrusted data to these functions, but third-party / external modules may. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.

CVE-2022-28330:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2022-28330
Описание: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds when configured to process requests with the mod_isapi module.

CVE-2022-29404:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2022-29404
Описание: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a lua script that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible input size.

CVE-2022-30556:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2022-30556
Описание: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths to applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer.

CVE-2022-31813:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2022-31813
Описание: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on client side Connection header hop-by-hop mechanism. This may be used to bypass IP based authentication on the origin server/application.

CVE-2006-20001:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2006-20001
Описание: A carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header value sent. This could cause the process to crash.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.54 and earlier.


CVE-2023-31122:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2023-31122
Описание: Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in mod_macro of Apache HTTP Server.This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: through 2.4.57.

CVE-2017-15710:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-15710
Описание: In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

CVE-2017-15715:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-15715
Описание: In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

CVE-2018-11763:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-11763
Описание: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.34, by sending continuous, large SETTINGS frames a client can occupy a connection, server thread and CPU time without any connection timeout coming to effect. This affects only HTTP/2 connections. A possible mitigation is to not enable the h2 protocol.

CVE-2018-1283:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-1283
Описание: In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.

CVE-2018-1301:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-1301
Описание: A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

CVE-2018-1302:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-1302
Описание: When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.

CVE-2018-1303:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-1303
Описание: A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability.

CVE-2018-1312:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-1312
Описание: In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.

CVE-2018-1333:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-1333
Описание: By specially crafting HTTP/2 requests, workers would be allocated 60 seconds longer than necessary, leading to worker exhaustion and a denial of service. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.18-2.4.30,2.4.33).

CVE-2018-17189:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17189
Описание: In Apache HTTP server versions 2.4.37 and prior, by sending request bodies in a slow loris way to plain resources, the h2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server thread cleaning up that incoming data. This affects only HTTP/2 (mod_http2) connections.

CVE-2018-17199:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17199
Описание: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session checks the session expiry time before decoding the session. This causes session expiry time to be ignored for mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded when the session is decoded.

CVE-2019-0196:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-0196
Описание: A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.38. Using fuzzed network input, the http/2 request handling could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when determining the method of a request and thus process the request incorrectly.

CVE-2019-0217:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-0217
Описание: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.38 and prior, a race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control restrictions.

CVE-2019-0220:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-0220
Описание: A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.38. When the path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers processing will implicitly collapse them.

CVE-2019-10081:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10081
Описание: HTTP/2 (2.4.20 through 2.4.39) very early pushes, for example configured with "H2PushResource", could lead to an overwrite of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes. The memory copied is that of the configured push link header values, not data supplied by the client.

CVE-2019-10082:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10082
Описание: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18-2.4.39, using fuzzed network input, the http/2 session handling could be made to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.

CVE-2019-17567:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-17567
Описание: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.6 to 2.4.46 mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation, authentication or authorization possibly configured.

CVE-2019-9517:
Ссылка: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-9517
Описание: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

CVE-2023-45802:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2023-45802
Описание: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

CVE-2021-31618:
Ссылка: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-apache-2021-31618
Описание: Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

CVE-2021-36160:

Описание: When storing and re-accessing data on a networking channel, the length of buffers may have been confused, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory read.
Through a series of API calls and redirects, an attacker-controlled alert dialog could have been displayed on another website (with the victim website's URL shown).
The fetch() API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the optional headers fetch() may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to poison the local browser cache by priming it with a fetch() response controlled by the additional headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected response.
A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a dropdown select input element. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.
If a website set a large custom cursor, portions of the cursor could have overlapped with the permission dialog, potentially resulting in user confusion and unexpected granted permissions.
A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and requestPointerLock to cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant.
Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser.
When opening a website using the firefox:// protocol handler, SameSite cookies were not properly respected.
The incorrect object was checked for NULL in the built-in profiler, potentially leading to invalid memory access and undefined behavior. Note: This issue only affects the application when the profiler is running.
Incorrect code generation could have led to unexpected numeric conversions and potential undefined behavior. Note: This issue only affects 32-bit ARM devices.

CVE-2024-1552:
Ссылка: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-05/
Описание: When storing and re-accessing data on a networking channel, the length of buffers may have been confused, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory read.
Through a series of API calls and redirects, an attacker-controlled alert dialog could have been displayed on another website (with the victim website's URL shown).
The fetch() API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the optional headers fetch() may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to poison the local browser cache by priming it with a fetch() response controlled by the additional headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected response.
A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a dropdown select input element. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.
If a website set a large custom cursor, portions of the cursor could have overlapped with the permission dialog, potentially resulting in user confusion and unexpected granted permissions.
A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and requestPointerLock to cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant.
Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser.
When opening a website using the firefox:// protocol handler, SameSite cookies were not properly respected.
The incorrect object was checked for NULL in the built-in profiler, potentially leading to invalid memory access and undefined behavior. Note: This issue only affects the application when the profiler is running.

Описание: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled.

CVE-2021-38507:
Ссылка: https://www.prio-n.com/kb/vulnerability/CVE-2021-38507
Описание: The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.
